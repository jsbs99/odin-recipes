    <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>Chicken Tinga is a popular Mexican dish that has shredded chicken in a delicious homemade sauce made from tomatoes, onions, adobo sauce with chilis, and spices. It is traditionally served on tostadas, but it is very versatile and is delicious in a taco, on nacos, and in many other dishes! Once you make it the first time, you may want to double the recipe because it is so delicious!</p>
